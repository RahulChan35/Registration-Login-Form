# Registration-Login-Form-
This project involves creating a simple web application where users can register with a username and password, and then log in using those credentials. The user data will be stored locally using the browser's LocalStorage API, which allows for persistent storage of key-value pairs.

Technologies Used:

HTML: To structure the form elements and layout.
CSS: To style the form and make it visually appealing.
JavaScript: To handle form validation, user input, and interaction with LocalStorage.
Key Features:

Registration Form:

Users can register by entering a unique username and password.
Passwords should ideally be hashed for better security, although for simplicity, we can store them directly (not recommended for production).
Login Form:

Registered users can log in using their username and password.
Validation ensures that only registered users with correct credentials can log in.
LocalStorage:

User credentials (username and password) are stored locally using LocalStorage.
Upon registration, the username-password pair is saved.
During login, the stored credentials are checked against user input to grant access.
Validation and Error Handling:

Ensure that usernames are unique.
Validate password strength (optional, but recommended).
Handle errors gracefully, displaying messages for incorrect login attempts or duplicate usernames.
Additional Considerations:

Security: While LocalStorage is convenient for this project, in real-world applications, consider more secure alternatives like SessionStorage, or better yet, server-side storage with secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for passwords.
User Experience: Design the forms to be intuitive and responsive, providing feedback on successful registrations and logins.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test your application across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
Goals:

Gain practical experience with HTML forms, CSS styling, and JavaScript for form validation and localStorage manipulation.
Understand the basics of user authentication and data persistence in web applications.
By completing this project, you'll have a solid foundation in building interactive forms, handling user input securely, and using browser storage effectively for small-scale applications.
